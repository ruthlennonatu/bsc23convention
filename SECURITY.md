Encryption protocols such as SSL/TLS will be used to secure data transmission over the network.
Encryption algorithms and key management practices will comply with industry standards and best practices.

4. Secure Software Development Practices
Code will undergo regular security reviews and static code analysis to identify and address vulnerabilities.
The use of third-party libraries and components will be monitored and updated to mitigate known security issues.
Secure coding practices will be enforced to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

5. Incident Response and Reporting
An incident response plan will be in place to handle security breaches, including the steps to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents.
All security incidents will be reported immediately to the designated security officer or IT department.
Logs and records of security incidents and their resolutions will be maintained for analysis and future prevention.

6. Regular Security Assessments
Regular security assessments, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, will be conducted to identify and remediate potential weaknesses in the system.
Compliance with industry security standards and regulations will be ensured through periodic audits.

7. Physical Security
Physical access to servers and infrastructure hosting the application will be restricted to authorized personnel only.
Physical security measures such as access controls and surveillance will be implemented at data centers hosting the system.

8. Training and Awareness
Regular security awareness training will be provided to all employees and users handling sensitive data or accessing the system.
Training programs will cover security best practices, phishing awareness, and incident reporting procedures.

9. Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements
The system will comply with all relevant data protection laws, industry regulations, and international security standards.
